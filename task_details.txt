Take-Home Project: Screen &amp; Webcam Recorder Desktop
App
Overview
In this project, you will build a desktop application using Electron that allows users to:
● View all available screens and windows.
● Select a screen or window to record.
● Optionally record their webcam video simultaneously.
● Save each recording session into a uniquely named folder inside a videos/ directory.
● Each session is stored in a folder named using a UUID.
● Screen and webcam recordings are saved as separate files (not merged).

This project is designed to simulate a real-world product scenario and evaluate your skills in
desktop app development with Electron, media handling, and file system management.
Project Goals
● Reproduce a clean, functional UI using your own design (no Figma provided).
● Use Electron to build a cross-platform desktop application.
● Allow users to preview and select any screen or window.
● Provide an option to toggle webcam recording on or off.
● Record screen and webcam feeds independently and allow users to start/stop each.
● Save all recordings to a videos/&lt;uuid&gt; folder.
○ Files should be saved as screen.webm and webcam.webm (if webcam is
enabled).

Directory Structure Example
videos/
├── 4a12ffac-b243-4fa3-8c9f-1123dfeaa342/
│ ├── screen.webm
│ └── webcam.webm
├── ...

A new UUID-based folder should be created for each recording session.

Suggested Tech Stack
● Electron
● TypeScript
● HTML/CSS (or optionally a UI framework such as React)

Optional Stretch Goals
● Add a &quot;Recording Complete&quot; screen with a button to open the recording folder.
● Let users rename their recording sessions.
● Display a live timer during recording.
● Add export settings for file format, bitrate, or custom save location.
● Create a merged final.mp4 file using ffmpeg or a similar tool (advanced).

Deliverables
● GitHub repository containing:
○ Full working source code
○ README with setup instructions (npm install, npm start)
○ A brief note on known limitations or edge cases
○ (Recommended) A screen recording showing your app in action

Tips
● Start by getting basic screen and webcam capture working independently.
● Use a simple layout for the UI – focus on clarity and functionality.
● Handle edge cases gracefully, such as:
○ User denying camera permissions
○ App being closed mid-recording
